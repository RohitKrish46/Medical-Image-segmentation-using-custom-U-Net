# U-Net
In this Project, We experimented with U-NET - A CNN that was developed for biomedical image segmentation. Generally the main idea behind any CNN is to learn the feature mapping of an image and produce a feature mapping. This works well in classification problems as the images are converted into a vector which used further for classification. But in semantic image segmentation, we not only need to convert feature map into a vector but also reconstruct an image from this vector to obtain results.
