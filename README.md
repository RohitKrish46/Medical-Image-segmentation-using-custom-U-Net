# Medical image segmentation using custom U-Net
In this project, I conducted experiments with U-Netâ€”a specialized convolutional neural network (CNN) designed for image segmentation. While traditional CNNs aim to learn feature mappings of images for classification tasks, they excel in converting images into vectors for further analysis. However, semantic image segmentation poses a unique challenge: not only must we convert feature maps into vectors, but we must also reconstruct images from these vectors to accurately delineate boundaries and structures within the image.
